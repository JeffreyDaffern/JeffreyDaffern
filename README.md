### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Jeff Daffern

Contact Me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreydaffern/)
- Based in Lehi, UT
- Available for: Full-Time and Remote Work

I am a full-stack developer and a hard worker; The kind of person that sees projects through to the end, no matter how difficult.  I am proud to have earned Certificates of Proficiency in both Web Programming and Software Development and am very dedicated, detail-oriented, and passionate about coding.  I am also easy-going and fun to work with.  Creating programs that make peopleâ€™s lives and jobs easier is what truly motivates me. I have an excellent memory and pick up new skills quickly.

I am most proficient in back-end programming, specifically with Java, but I have also worked with languages such as PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap for front-end development. I am very familiar with SQL and GitHub as well. I work with Putty, MySQL, and Git on a daily basis, which has familiarized me with the Linux command line.

I have done volunteer work for the Salt Lake City homeless shelter to design and create brochures for homeless people. This gave me insights into design processes that are transferrable to web design.
